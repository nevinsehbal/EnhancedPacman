### Enhanced Pacman in Python with PyGame

This is an enhanced implementation of the Pac-Man game, which uses [Pacman in Python with PyGame](https://github.com/hbokmann/Pacman?tab=readme-ov-file) project as the codebase.

The enhancements are:

* [ ] Maze generation: In each run of the game, a new maze is generated.
* [ ] Strategy-AI: Ghosts are spawned at the positions in order to maximize the possibility of winning the game.
* [ ] Tactical-AI: Ghost movements are decided with a distance sensing mechanism.
* [ ] Analystics: The movements of the entities are logged in an analytics module in each game.
